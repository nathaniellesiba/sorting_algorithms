in the best case

O(n)
In the best case, the array is already sorted, and the algorithm only needs to make a single pass through the elements to confirm this.

in the average case
O(n^2)
In the average case, the algorithm has to make multiple passes through the array to ensure that all elements are in the correct order.

in the worst case
O(n^2)
In the worst case, the array is sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm needs to make the maximum number of comparisons and swaps at each step.
